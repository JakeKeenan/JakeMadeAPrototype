			<h3>The Modern Face of Doublethink</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: -30px;">Know the workings of a presidency detached from truth.</h2>
			<p>
				This website is, at best, a portrait of presidential doublethink and gross incompetency at best.
				The meat of our message
				is built off the rule that for every Trump action there is a 
				Trump tweet criticizing that action.

				There's a lot we've learned about the U.S. president over his some three odd years, and there's plenty more
				we'll discover in what remains of the months he has left in power. Whether or not 
				you agree with Donald Trump's service to these United States, there's a realization we should all be able
				to come	to regarding the self documented nature of his thinking.

				<p style="text-indent:0px; text-align:center">
				Some might love him and his deeds now, but we need to be beware of what he is.

			What is doublethink?
			</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
				Doublethink is a term coined by George Orwell in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. It's used
				to describe one's ability to beleive in two opposing systems of thought simultaniously without seeing
				conflict in their positions. Today's examples of doublethink might include pro-lifers who, while beleiving
				in the sanctaty of life, also beleive in capital punishment and the execution of criminals. 
				Another example might be the people who'll tell you that immigrants are lazy scroungers while 
				also being the same people who steal our jobs. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent:0px;">Put best by George Orwell, doublethink is the ability</p>
				<blockquote>
				To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, 
				when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence 
				of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies
				</blockquote>
				<p>
				Today doublethink is the most dangerous tool of one of the globe's most powerful politicians. 
				Donald trump uses it to misinform and shirk accountability. Unintentionally or not, he uses it
				to loft himself on a back and fourth platform immune from the inconvenient reality.
